The Yelp Business Reviews WordPress widget plugin lets you showcase Yelp reviews in a variety of professional-looking predesigned widgets.

For many businesses, it can be a challenge to present user reviews in an eye catching way. This widget solves that problem, giving you a wide variety of customization options so that you can display your Yelp reviews proudly on your website.

The main reason for doing this is to garner social proof.

What is social proof?

It’s essentially what happens as a result of word of mouth and positive feedback. The more customers you have raving about your products, services, or customer support, the easier it will be for you to convince others to choose you over the competition.

### Why are Yelp reviews so important?

Yelp reviews are important because they give customers a clear indication of how the business deals with customers, and whether or not it’s worth giving them a shot.

You can create a buzz around your brand without even investing a lot of money into elaborate marketing campaigns. After all, reviews are a free form of marketing, so provided that you’re able to collect them from customers you can drum up more business in a cost-effective manner.

If you don’t have many Yelp reviews yet, one of the best strategies is to post out review links through email or social media. With the right wording, you can convince customers that leaving a review will help the business to grow which benefits both parties.
